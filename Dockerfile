# Run the service.
#
# NOTE: The configuration files for the service must be
#       mapped to the path: /opt/dxlvtapiservice-config
#
# For example, specify a "-v" argument to the run command
# to mount a directory on the host as a data volume:
#
#   -v /host/dir/to/config:/opt/dxlvtapiservice-config
#
# Run the service as an unprivileged user. The configuration directory is only
# read - these services log to stdout - so a host directory mounted there has
# to be readable by this user, not owned by it.
